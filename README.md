# Heli - Simple FreeGLUT Project

This project is done for fun in pure FreeGLUT, no external resources are used. src/main.cpp is the only source code file of the heli project. It is used to test my [kit-opengl project](https://github.com/furkantokac/kit-opengl) so I didn't spend so much time on the code so it kind of sucks, but may be useful to someone.
